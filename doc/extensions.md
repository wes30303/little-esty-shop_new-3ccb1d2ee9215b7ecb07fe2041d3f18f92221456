### Tier 1 - Least Difficult

```
As an admin     
When I visit an admin invoices index page
I see each of the invoices statuses
I also have the ability to manage all invoice statuses on the page at the same time.
I can change multiple statuses via a dropdown list or checkboxes.
When I click the update button, I see the changes reflected on the index page for each invoice I updated.
```

```
As an admin, merchant, or visitor
On all pages that list all merchants, invoices, or items
I see a button to sort the list alphabetically, and I see a button to sort by most recent date.
When I click these buttons, the list is updated accordingly.
```

#### Styling

Implement a consistent look and feel throughout your site with reusable styles.

You could use a framework for this such as: [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)

[Bootstrap Ruby Gem](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-rubygem)

Or, you could create custom styles!

### Tier 2 - Difficult

#### Filters

```
As an admin, I have the ability to see all items on the site
I can also filter the results of this page by any item attribute

Search boxes for both name and description
Check boxes for merchant names
Greater than, less than, and equal to options for unit price
Greater than, less than, and equal to options for created at and updated at
```
